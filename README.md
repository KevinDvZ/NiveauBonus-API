# niveaubonus-API
My own personal website api rest, developped in Java langage

## Whats is the purpose of this API ?

I wanted an interface between the MYSQL database of my website and the front-end. Dispatch responsabilites between several projects that comunicates between us, inside my dedicated server is more convenient for maintenance and future updates.

There are my main objectives with this project :

1. allow to keep an encrypted password in mysql database, not a clear one.
2. endpoints that send json format, containing all css variables needed by the front made in VueJS
3. Keep articles of the blog and datas of my CV.
